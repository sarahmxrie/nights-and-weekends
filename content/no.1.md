Today I finished my first bullet journal. Since I found my way into journaling, I've always preferred writing with a pen rather than on my laptop or phone. Somehow my Latin middle school teacher talking about how the learning effect of doing the hand movement while writing with a pen gets lost by typing on a phone or laptop got stuck in my head. I like remembering things, so I always thought it would be better to write to-do lists on paper. The development from paper to bullet journal happened only a couple of months ago. I've already journaled before that, but I don't think I did it that frequently. Most of the time I enjoy reflecting on what's going on in my life and it didn't take me much time. However, there are these moments where I just don't want to journal. In those moments I look at the grey notebook, which always lies somewhere obvious, so I don't forget to use it, and I'll tell myself that it's okay because "I don't have much to reflect on right now". Well, in those kinds of situations I am probably needing it the most. It's when I don't want to open the door to my feelings because I am scared. Scared of what could suddenly jump at me when I am not prepared. Scared of realizations I don't want to face because they could hurt. Scared of accepting that I am not fine even if I tell everyone around me I am (including myself).

Have you ever binge-watched a series? Couldn't stop watching the next episode because of the cliffhanger? Stayed up way too long - so long that when telling people they look at you like "are you crazy"?

I have. Actually, I did that yesterday. Why? I don't know. Is it so difficult to click the "x" button and prevent Netflix from playing the next episode automatically? No, that's not it. I know, some of you might think now "that's it? that's not too bad, stop being such a crybaby". But for me it is a big deal. I feel so shitty about myself the next day. I don't feel like I deserve diving into that other world where all my worries don't exist. 
I need to work. I have to earn money. I have to find something I want to do with my life. I need a perspective. Those kinds of thoughts are haunting me all the time. I cannot relax, not a single bit. The day before yesterday I had a fun night out with my flatmate and my best friend but suddenly while sitting in the outdoor area of the club we went to, the fun fa√ßade simply crumbled. My thoughts went from having a "great time" to "you are a failure, you don't deserve to have fun" real quick.

Those are pretty raw emotions, not very uplifting nor pretty - I know. While writing this entry I thought: okay so how do I turn that around? How do I end this entry on a positive note? To be honest, I don't feel those positive emotions right now so I also don't feel like searching for motivational words for you or myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm aware that tomorrow is a new day and that emotions can be very different in the morning.

Nonetheless, I can feel the storm of emotions boiling up subliminally.
