nice to meet you! i'm sarah and this blog is going to be my creative playground where i emphazise on [[reflections]] and [[aestetics]]. you could probably say that it has a journal kind of vibe. also, you can expect longer texts and insights on my feelings, which may sometimes be raw or intense. 

in addition, as i want to delve deeper into languages you will probably find entries in different kind of languages starting with english and [[quartz/content/german|german]] right now. 

everything is still pretty much in the making but stay tuned for more coming up soon! 

curious and wanna know more [[about me]] ?
