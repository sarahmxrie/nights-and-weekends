title: about
---
i'm 25 years old and was born and raised in berlin, germany. except being abroad for an internship (china) or while traveling a couple of times (i.e., guatemala, colombia, thailand), i've been living in berlin my whole life. most of the time, i liked living in berlin (if you just pretend the months january until april don't exist) - especially during my undergraduate program in biotechnology at the "berliner hochschule f√ºr technik" (formerly "beuth university of applied science"). at that time, i also worked at the healthcare start-up "heartbeat medical" (which launched a software for patient-reported outcome measures, where i initially got in touch with vsc and gitlab/github). i finally graduated in august 2022 and let me tell you: it's been a rollercoaster since then. 

i worked at a lot of different places - sometimes only a couple of days, sometimes weeks or months. however, not a single job in the past two years was something i did for the sake of my mind and heart. i mean, don't get me wrong, i had an amazing time working at a christmas market selling mulled wine (stand 1 all the way!!!!) but that definitely did not satisfy my urge to do something that has a positive impact on the planet or at least something that contributes to a meaningful purpose. with that, we have arrived in 2024 - which also has been emotionally ecstatic on the one hand psychologically devastating on the other hand (am I being dramatic? definitely not).

habitually, when telling people about how i feel, i tend to begin with the positive stuff to create an image of me in which i am a positive-thinking person - no matter how shitty things have been for me (even though i definitely don't feel that way sometimes).
so here we go:

| went to guatemala for 7 weeks, had a blast, learned a lot about myself once again, did a lot of journaling, went on the acatenango hike (absolutely among the top 3 experiences i have ever had)                                                                                                                                        | started the application process for a gruaduate program at "seoul national university" in fall 2023, put a whole fucking lot of effort into that application, may 23rd (one day after my birthday): got a rejection with the lovely one-worded note: "declined"                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| got a new flatmate starting of february, things are looking great, it's developing into one of those deep emotional connections i seek so much, she's also a huge inspiration to me regarding fashion, photography and aestetics (something i always wanted to delve deeper into but never had the inspiration to get the ball rolling) | since seoul didn't work out, i applied to several universities in germany (mostly in hamburg, berlin, freiburg, halle and leipzig). the "freie universitaet" in berlin was definitely my number one wish, but guess what: got rejected today. since it was the only university in berlin i applied to, i am basically screwed right now regarding my future prospects because i have no clue what i am going to next....move to another city??? oh hell nah. |

i have to add one positive thing to what happened in 2024 (because you already now - of course i ALWAYS stay positive): somehow i made my way to buildspace and nights & weekends - if i hadn't found that path, this whole blog would still not exist. therefore, shoutout to farza and the whole gang who finally made me do the first step into creating my own little creative space. 
last but not least i have to mention the person who introduced me to buildspace: the jonas. my number one supporter who never stopped - and never will stop - believing in me (uno reverse card). i now that might be a little corny but i don't care. he's truly an exceptional and genuine person.

well, now you basically know who i am. you are very welcome to follow me on my journey through my twenties where i (hopefully) find something meaningful to do.

peace out ya'll.
