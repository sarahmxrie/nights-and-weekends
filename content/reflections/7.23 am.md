even though this is the first reflections entry, it's not the first one i wrote. a couple of days ago i had a weak moment where i needed to put my thoughts into words. to be honest it's one of those texts which deeply show who i am. at some point i definitely want to publish these kind of reflections too but right now that is too much of a challenge. however, when i thought about what i want to share as my first reflections entry i somehow had the imediate urge that is has to be something positive or encouraging. why do i always get the feeling that something dark is too heavy? even though my feelings and thoughts are not the most uplifting right now. in general, i would say i'm fine. there are a couple of things that keep me from drowning in my feeling of being lost. one of those things is for sure doing a lot of sport. i grew up in a very health and sport centered family what i now consider as a big fortune even though it also had it's down sides from time to time. i started doing athletics when i was 6 years old - always being pretty mediocre and never one of the best. that was probably the reason why i quit because i thought i wasn't good enough. i hated competition, hated being of the last. school was the same. i went to a private middle and high school where i was in the "smart" class. to get into that class you had to do a test and be selected by the school. i think i reached place 32 or 33 and the maximum where 30 pupils. there is this german saying which basically translates into "luck in misfortune" what fits in this situation perfectly. a few people didn't want the spot so somehow i got in. the following years i always felt like one of the dumbest in my class. most of my classmates seemed to have a goal in life - some of them wanted to become doctors, lawyers or simply study business at oxford. 
the feeling of belonging to the lower half of society while growing up has definetely ingrained. comparing myself to my classmates and the other atheletes i missled myself into underestimating me. at some point i got competitive trying to find my limits while studying or doing sports. i wish i already knew when i was 18 what i am capable of because i probably would have chosen to study psychology then. i would say that's probably one of my biggest regrets yet. nevertheless, i figured out that i am smarter and better in sports than i always thought i was. those things are not my insecurities anymore - i would even count them as my strengths. 
although i managed to reflect on those moments and feelings when i was younger there is still one thing i am still struggling a lot with. 

the feeling of being lost. how am i supposed to know what to do with my life? i have no clue where i want to end up or what to do from here. sure, i have a bachelor's degree in biotechnology but now what? i wish i was as determined on one thing as some of my former classmates where or still are. even though my grandparents and parents tend to tell me how lucky i am that i can just devide on what i want to do i don't feel like that's fortunate. on the contrary, i am extremely overwhelmed. the last two years i started trying to take it step by step and don't pressure myself. easier said than done since i am getting older in that process. still,
